## The tls Client Capability

The tls client capability indicates that the server supports the STARTTLS command.

It is worth noting here that a client may request the tls capability with CAP REQ,
but this won't affect that client's ability to later send the STARTTLS command.
The STARTTLS command will always operate on servers which advertise the capability
regardless of if the client requests the capability or not. 

To use STARTTLS a client simply sends the STARTTLS command to the server before the
client registers with the server using the NICK and USER commands, the server then
sends numeric 670 (RPL_STARTTLS), and the client initiates a SSL/TLS handshake.

If there is an error with setting up TLS on the server side, the server must send
numeric 691 (ERR_STARTTLS) containing a human-readable description of the error as
it's parameter.
